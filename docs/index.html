            <h2>About this guide</h2>
            <p>This is a guide to LISPsmos, the programming language which compiles to Desmos expressions. This document is CTRL+F-friendly, so if you're looking to do a specific thing, just hit Ctrl+F, and you'll be likely to find the result with few (if any) false positives!</p>
            <h2>Installation / Quick Start</h2>
            <div class="collapsible">
                <ol>
                    <li>Get <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>, if you haven't already.</li>
                    <li>Create a directory in which you will put your first LISPsmos project. Call it whatever you want.</li>
                    <li>Go to the terminal, navigate to the directory you've created, and type in <code>npm install lispsmos</code>. This will allow you to use LISPsmos </li>
                    <li>Create a file <code>index.mjs</code> in the directory. Paste the following code into index.js:
<code>
    <pre>
import * as lispsmos from "lispsmos";

lispsmos.buildServer(async () => {
    let compiler = new lispsmos.compiler.LispsmosCompiler();
    console.log("Compiled!");
    return await compiler.compile("(displayMe (= y (^ x 3)))")
})
    </pre>
</code>
This code will create a web server which&mdash; when accessed&mdash; will compile some LISPsmos code into a Desmos Graph state object and send it to whoever requested it. We will use this web server to compile LISPsmos code and send it to Desmos where it can be displayed as a graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>Type <code>node index.mjs</code> to start the web server.</li>
                    <li>Try testing your web server by going to <a href="http://localhost:8090">http://localhost:8090</a>. You can use a custom port and hostname (second and third parameter to <code>buildServer</code>) if you so desire.</li>
                    <li>Now that we've created a LISPsmos server, we need to tell Desmos how to receive the LISPsmos graph. First, get <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a>.</li>
                    <li>Install <a href="https://gist.github.com/radian628/27f73fb2f2675b24c363fa8186bdce13/raw/b90570ba659fc509cdf57a060f5945e7287af51a/desmos-state-grabber.user.js">this Tampermonkey userscript</a>, which will add a text box to Desmos which will enable you to load Desmos graph state from any source.</li>
                    <li>Once the userscript is installed and enabled, find the new textbox in Desmos in the bottom-right corner, type <code>http://localhost:8090</code> into it, and press the "Grab State" button. You should see that the graph has changed to show the equation Y=x<sup>3</sup>. This userscript does the exact same thing that you did when you tried to go to <a href="http://localhost:8090">http://localhost:8090</a>&mdash; it requests the Desmos state, which the server promptly compiles. However, after that, it gives the graph state to Desmos, which displays it like it would any other graph.</li>

            <h2>Syntax</h2>
            <div class="collapsible">
                <h3>Polish Notation</h3>
                <p>LISPsmos follows an extremely simple (but quite unorthodox) syntax called Polish notation. Normally, when you're doing math&mdash; for instance, <code>1 + 2 + 3</code>&mdash; you put the operator <code>+</code> between the operands <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. In LISPsmos, which uses Polish notation, you would write the same expression like this: <code>(+ 1 2 3)</code>. The first thing in the list&mdash; the "<code>+</code>," is treated as an operator, whereas everything after it is treated as its operands. This may seem very odd to some. However, there are some advantages to this approach which I hope you will come to appreciate: For one, it's extremely consistent&mdash; <i>every</i> operator in LISPsmos works like this, making one's mental model of the syntax much simpler. For another advantage, it also cuts down on extra operators. Notice how we only used a single <code>+</code> by using Polish notation. Conversely, with the more "standard" infix notation, we used two of them! On top of all this, Polish notation isn't actually that far off from what we already do with other functions: For instance, <code>sin(x)</code> becomes <code>(sin x)</code> and <code>mod(x, 2)</code> becomes <code>(mod x 2)</code>.</p>
                <p>Do be aware, however, that the <i>semantics</i> of LISPsmos are somewhat more complicated than this at times&mdash; some complex operators may define slightly different rules that do not exist outside of them (which will be explained as they come up). However, the underlying syntax will remain the same.</p>
                <h3>Basic Examples</h3>
                <p>Here are some examples of LISPsmos syntax compared to (approximately) how they would appear in Desmos:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>LISPsmos</th><th>Desmos Output (approx)</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(+ 1 2 3 4 5)</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">\left(1+2+3+4+5\right)</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(* 5 (+ 2 3))</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">\left(5*\left(2+3\right)\right)</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(sin (* 3 x))</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">\sin\left(\left(3*x\right)\right)</span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>Create a variable with the <code>=</code> operator. Be aware that (like everything in LISPsmos) this follows Polish notation. Here is an example</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>LISPsmos</th><th>Desmos Output (approx)</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(= a 5)</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">a=5</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(= y (^ x 2))</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">y=x^{2}</span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Variables can have multi-character names. LISPsmos will represent these with subscripts in Desmos.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>LISPsmos</th><th>Desmos Output (approx)</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(= foo 12)</code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">f_{oo}=12</span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>Create a function with the <code>fn</code> keyword, followed by its name, then its arguments separated by spaces, and then finally its actual definition in a single block. Take note of the second example&mdash; LISPsmos does not care about line breaks in the middle of expressions. Use them to make long expressions easier to read.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>LISPsmos</th><th>Desmos Output (approx)</th></tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>(fn square x (^ x 2))<br>
                                (square 4)
                        </code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">s_{quare}\left(x\right)=x^{2}</span><br><span class="equation">s_{quare}\left(4\right)</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code><pre>(fn dist x1 y1 x2 y2 (sqrt (+ 
    (^ (- x1 x2) 2)
    (^ (- y1 y2) 2)
)))</pre></code></td>
                        <td><span class="equation">d_{ist}\left(x_{1},y_{1},x_{2},y_{2}\right)=\sqrt{\left(\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{2}\right)^{2}\right)}</span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h2>Display/Show Expressions</h2>
            <div class="collapsible">
                <h3>Display an Expression</h3>
                <p>Up until now, you won't have seen anything on the screen upon loading your LISPsmos expressions. This changes now&mdash; use the <code>displayMe</code> operator to display an expression. The expression should be the first argument to <code>displayMe</code>. Be warned that you can only put a single expression into displayMe.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>LISPsmos</th><th>Desmos Output (approx)</th></tr>
                    <tr>

                </table>
                <h3>Display Properties</h3>
                <p>You can set "display properties" of an expression to customize the way it is displayed. For instance, the graph produced by the following LISPsmos code (not shown on screen) will have a line width of 20 pixels, be dotted, have 20% opacity, and be a bright red color.</p>

                <p>Want to change the size of the default starting graph? LISPsmos can do that too. For instance, the line <code>(viewport -2 2 -2 2)</code> will try to make the graph range from -2 to 2 on the x-axis, and -2 to 2 on the y-axis. However, Desmos will still try to preserve aspect ratio, so this will not be exact!</p>
